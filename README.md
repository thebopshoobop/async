# Taming Asyncronous JavaScript

This is the companion repository to [an article](https://medium.com/@rwillt/taming-asynchronous-javascript-6da77b6729af) I wrote on asynchronous JavaScript patterns. 

To get run it, you just need to clone, pull down requirements with `$ npm i`, seed the database with `$ node seeds`, and then fire it up with `$ node app`. If you don't have a MongoDB server handy I've had good luck with [mLab](https://mlab.com/).
