# Taming Asyncronous JavaScript

This is the companion repository to [an article](https://medium.com/@rwillt/taming-asynchronous-javascript-6da77b6729af) I wrote on asynchronous JavaScript patterns. 

To get started, you just need to clone, `npm i`, run `$ node seeds`, and then fire it up with `$ node app`. If you don't have a MongoDB server handy I've had good luck with [mLab](https://mlab.com/).
